# Imotions
**AI-Powered Mental Health Companion**

Imotions is a research-driven project exploring how Artificial Intelligence can detect and analyze human emotions across multiple modalities like **text, images and video**.  
The goal is to integrate these into a unified **Mental Health AI Companion**, capable of providing insights into emotional well-being and supporting mental health awareness.
